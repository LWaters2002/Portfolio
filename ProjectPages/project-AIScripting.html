          title="Utility System"
          description="My own implemenation of utility AI, this system takes into account a unit's intelligence to induce variable fuzzy logic, furthermore depending on a units weighting it will favour, offensive or defence playstyles; meaning the utility system can create a large range of behaviours with simple parameter changes, in addition due to the parameter driven nature; gameplay effects can directly affect the behaviour of an AI, e.g. an unit could be taunted and become fully offensive or a barbarian could be made a coward and run away. <br><br> This is brilliant as it allows gameplay altering effects to feel much more natural and reactive, which helps the AI imitate a human player and adds weight to it's actions."
