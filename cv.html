            <h5 style="margin-top:-40px">Games Programmer</h5>

            <p style="text-align: left;">I’m Liam, a gameplay programmer that wants to sink their teeth into anything
                games; I love the synergy of
                different crafts from music to programming; currently I’m studying games design and programming at
                Staffordshire university, and I’ve got great aptitude when it comes to learning or doing anything tech
                furthermore; I tend to fuel my curiosity through applying ideas or methods from other mediums and
                applying them to programming particularly maths.
                because of this I often find myself collaborating, learning and teaching from others in and out of the
                games field. I believe these qualities of mine make me an ideal candidate for a games programmer.
